1. **Identify and explain the workings of TWO sorting algorithms and discuss and compare their performance/efficiency (i.e. Big O)**  
Two commonly used sorting algorithms are Bubble Sort and Quick Sort.  
- **Bubble Sort**  
Bubble Sort is a simple and straightforward comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order until the entire list is sorted. The process resembles bubbles rising to the surface in a liquid, which gives the algorithm its name.
Bubble Sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements to be sorted. This is because in the worst-case scenario, each element needs to be compared and swapped multiple times to reach its correct position. The best-case time complexity occurs when the list is already sorted, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n). However, Bubble Sort is generally inefficient for large lists due to its quadratic time complexity.  
- **Quick Sort**  
Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It selects a pivot element from the list and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays. The pivot selection and partitioning steps make Quick Sort significantly faster than Bubble Sort.
The average and best-case time complexity of Quick Sort is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements to be sorted. Quick Sort achieves this complexity by dividing the list into smaller sub-arrays and sorting them independently. However, in the worst-case scenario, when the pivot selection is poor, Quick Sort can degrade to a time complexity of O(n^2), which is the same as Bubble Sort. To mitigate this, various techniques, such as selecting a random or median-of-three pivot, can be employed.

In terms of efficiency, Quick Sort outperforms Bubble Sort in most cases. Bubble Sort's quadratic time complexity makes it inefficient for large lists, whereas Quick Sort's average and best-case time complexity of O(n log n) provides better performance. However, Quick Sort's worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) can be a disadvantage in certain situations. Thus, the choice of algorithm depends on the characteristics of the input data and the desired time complexity.
